Our lab is dedicated to understanding the impact of extreme heat on human health and developing strategies to mitigate its effects. We focus on identifying current gaps in heat action and mitigation plans, with the goal of creating more effective and equitable solutions. Our research emphasizes collaboration with state and county health departments, as well as community-based organizations, to reduce heat-related morbidity and mortalityâ€”especially among vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by climate-related stressors.
