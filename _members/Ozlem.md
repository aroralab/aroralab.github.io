description: "I am a physician from Türkiye. My concern for the environment and compassion for all the living beings inspired me to start my MPH program at the U of A. Currently, I am working on my APE project, “The Impact of Medication Use on the Body’s Ability to Cope with Heat and Recommendations for Prevention.”
