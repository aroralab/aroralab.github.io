description: "Imran received his  MPH from the James P Grant School of Public Health, Bangladesh. His thesis  focused on how dietary partern impacts the nutritional status of college-going urban adolescents. 

In the Arora lab, I address pressing environmental health challenges, particularly those impacting marginalized communities, which drives my research. Through this platform, I aim to share insights from my academic and professional pursuits, connect with fellow researchers, and inspire collaborative solutions for a healthier, more equitable world. Thank you for joining me on this journey toward impactful change.

Outside of lab, Imran enjoys cooking and board games."
